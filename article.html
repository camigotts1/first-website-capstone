            <h2>So My Trader Joes Cashier Isn't in Love With Me??</h2>
            <h3>By Camille</h3>
            <p>
                There we were, at the cash register. He held my Chili & Lime Flavored Rolled
                Corn Tortilla Chips so tenderly. He smiled. Said those were his favorites. The
                Hold the Cone Ice Cream Cones? A great choice.
                The new Ube Ice Cream? He's been wanting to try it.
                I knew that was my chance - he was hinting that he wants to try it <i>with me!</i>
                I was too shy, so I smiled and said "Yeah, it's really good." So stupid. So bland.
                He wrang me up. I tapped my card, said thank you, and left.
                I knew I needed to redeem myself next time.
            </p>

                The next week, I gathered my groceries. I threw a few new items in my basket -
                things I knew would catch his attention. But there I was, second in line. I couldn't
                believe what I was hearing. "Good choice" ?? "That's my favorite" ?? He's complimenting
                someone else's groceries. Then he starts commenting on the next lady's groceries. My
                heart dropped to my stomach. Has this all just been a show? Was I just some pawn in his sick
                deceptive game?

                Have all of us been led on by our local Trader Joe's Crewmembers?
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes. Apparently we have.
            </p>
            <p>
                Millions of shoppers every year suffer from Main Character Syndrome
                caused by the overly flirtatious demeanors of Trader Joe's Crewmembers
                across the United States. The takeaway: don't fall in love in Trader Joe's.
