            <div class="description">
                <div class="text">This wine is so lovely. Light, slightly effervescent, lightly sweet.
                    It pairs well with food or by itself (or mixed in a cocktail!).
                    At only $5 after tax, it's really hard to beat. I always have a bottle of this to
                    sip by myself, or to share. There is also a rose version that is almost the same
                    in taste, but...er...<i>rosier</i>.

            <div class="description">
                <div class="text">These sweet empanadas are so delicious. Basically like a pumpkin hand pie.
                    I usually prepare these in the toaster oven, and they get a nice crispy crust,
                    but sometimes when I am impatient I will just microwave them. The only complaint I have
                    about these is that they are only seasonal!! And they sell out QUICK.

            <div class="description">
                <div class="text">I resisted buying these for so long. How special could ice cream in a cone
                    really be?? But these are. I don't know. Something about the cone is sooooo tasty.
                    There's a bit of chocolate on the bottom to keep the ice cream from melting out
                    the cone hole. My favorite are the vanilla, because I don't care for the chocolate cone.
                    I wish they had a mint or some other flavor with the classic cone.

                <div class="text">I just recently tried these. Obsessed.
                    They have a bit of a kick but aren't as hot as hot Cheetos (if you're a weenie
                    like me and think hot cheetos are spicy). So tasty. So bad for you.

            <div class="description">
                <div class="text"> I love this proscuitto. Specifically this one. The other kinds
                    are ok, but this is <i>*chef's kiss*. </i> I eat this on the drive home from the store.
                    I used to work in the charcuterie section of Whole Foods, and I still get this.
                    I mean, you really can't beat the price ($4??). It's light, salty, tender.

                <div class="text">
                    I am a simple woman. I like ube. I like ice cream. I buy this every time it's in stock.
                    It's a good amount of sweetness (could be less sweet, but it has to appeal to the masses
                    y'know?). It's so creamy. I will say, it does have a slight *grittiness* to it,
                    which doesn't bother me at all, but I do know some people may have texture issues.
